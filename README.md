Cat Identification openCV project in C++, WIP
Intention to make a software that will sort pictures of cats into different catagories, integration with a simple album application will allow users to upload cat images and name each cat.
Expected outcomes would be to be able to at least accurately separate different colored and patterned cats, based on the face.
